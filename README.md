# MachineLearningSeminar-2019

Week of February 12 2019: Start with the "Overview and getting started" notebook. You can fork my repository or simply download that notebook and the three files that start "mysteryclassification".

Next week, we'll look at decision trees in more detail. How do you decide when/where to split? What other parameters can the modeler control?
